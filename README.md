# progressive-budget

This is a progressive web application (PWA) allowing users to create a budget.

A key advantage of a PWA is its offline functionality, so users can enter deposits and expenses offline that are added to the tracker when they're back online.

Users can view their account balance as well as a list of transactions (showing both expenses and deposits). Each transaction can be deleted (from being viewed) by clicking on the red X.
